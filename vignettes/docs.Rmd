# What is FlomKartShinyApp? 

This is an R shiny app to visualize the results of flood frequency analysis at NVE.

# How was it coded?

In 'Package Ref', you'll find the documentation of all the packaged functions that are used by the app.
The app uses 'flood_database.nc' and 'gof.nc' as data sources. Those files are produced by running the 'FlomKart' package ([doc](http://NVE.github.io/FlomKart) and [code](http://github.com/NVE/FlomKart))

For the moment, the functions 'global.R', 'server.R' and 'ui.R' have not been packaged and are stored in the root directory of the repository.
