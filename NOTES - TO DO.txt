First tab: 
- What to plot on the map: which pop-ups? Color marking of which parameter?
- What to plot in barplot/boxplot? Normalized flood data with catchment size or mean annual flood (this could be an optional input). Remove opacity from barplot
- TODO: Add Regine_nb and Main_nb to the NetCDF so that groups can be done in this tab. Also add Rain_Fraction


Main tab:

When choosing a record length < full record, the plot of modelled data is updated but not the resampled data.
That means that we see the performance of the fit using less data against the full data set.
- TODO: give the option to plot the fitted distribution against the sub-sampled record and not just against the full record
Have an error bar for the plotting position (use bootstrapping)

Other tabs:

Put the same scale on each row of plots for the GOF indicators: this would be best done by rewriting the plotting functions.
Could be done with a plotly re-write / shiny modules implementation

- TODO: plot titles for the CV tabs should mention CV and not just r.levels (same for BS and QS)
Add histogram of the number of stations used, or do sub-sampling up to 90 years even for stations that have less data (thanks to replacement)

The best m/d combination for full record length should be calculated out of the server function

Mapping:
Add catchment boundaries, replace openstreetmap by Norwegian topomap. This would help to see rivers, lakes, glaciers, topography

Allow choice of parameter (GOF, length_rec, normalized return level quantiles with catchment size or mean annual flood...) for marker color/size. Try to automate legends as f(parameter to map)
-> modularize the mapping functions

TIDY-UP: Coeff and coef cohabit!

Map with coefficient of variation
Exponentionally growing dots for plotting information in maps

					TO DISCUSS / INVESTIGATE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

I tried to deploy the app to Rstudio shinyapps.io but it doesn't seem to support the NetCDF files.

We completely gave up LogPearson?!

Plot relevant tables in Shiny?
An average of ALL GOF for the map groups tab?

I don't think GL/MOM is buggy. It just fits a bit differently than the other methods and the fitted model tends to be
shifted to the right, with usually a better descrption of the tail

Packages to check out:
shinyjs, sparkline, KScorrect

formatRound
formatRoundCheckboxes?
